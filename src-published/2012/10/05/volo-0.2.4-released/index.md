Just a small update for [volo](http://volojs.org), but it adds a simple
*npm info* command and includes an alias for *install* that points to *add*.

It also fixes an [edge case bug](https://github.com/volojs/volo/issues/102)
that is bad enough that you should upgrade to 0.2.4 as soon as possible.

    npm install -g volo
