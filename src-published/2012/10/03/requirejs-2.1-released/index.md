[RequireJS 2.1.0 is available](http://www.requirejs.org/docs/download.html).

This release refines some execution rules around cycles and transpilers, and
how shimmed code can be wired up. There are a couple changes that may require
modifications to your code when you upgrade.

See
[Upgrading to 2.1](https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/wiki/Upgrading-to-RequireJS-2.1)
for more information.
