A maintenance release for [volo](http://volojs.org) that fixes some issues around branch fetching and proper ordering of version tags. [List of fixed 0.2.7 issues](https://github.com/volojs/volo/issues?milestone=10&page=1&state=closed).

Upgrading is recommended:

    npm install -g volo

Also, if you have a GitHub repo that can be used as a `volo create` project template, feel free to add it to the [create template directory](https://github.com/volojs/volo/wiki/Create-templates).
