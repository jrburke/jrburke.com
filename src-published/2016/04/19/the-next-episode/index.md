After joining Mozilla Messaging just over seven years ago, I start a new job later this month. I am thankful for [Alex](https://infrequently.org/)'s introduction to [David](http://ascher.ca/) that led to the Mozilla job.

I moved up to Vancouver to experiment with web-based messaging. That led to a few experiments at Mozilla, most recently the Firefox OS email app front end. However, all the experiments I worked on at Mozilla were eventually shut down. It is time for me to try working on a different kind of project.

I will be cheering on the efforts at Mozilla to improve the browser, and integrate web content better with native platforms via features like service workers and web manifests. I would like to see first class placement of web experiences on native platforms that work well with background updates, offline use. A Mozilla-infused Android distribution with web content front and center, some secure messaging and ties to local communities would be neat to see.

The web rendering developments in [Servo](https://servo.org/) are exciting too. Do you want to learn a [neat language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and help them out? Check out the [first bugs list](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3AE-easy). The Rust and Servo communities are really great.

While I appreciate the value of platform work, it is more work for me than the flow I feel when building on web apps. So I am off to work on a web app that helps educators organize their classes. I still plan to do some light open source work on my own time, make sure I keep up maintenance releases for RequireJS related tools. But I will be busy with an exciting new job, and I will not have a lot of left over energy for a while. I will be staying in Vancouver.

Thank you Mozilla, and the people I worked with, for seven years. It changed my life. I recommend [working at Mozilla](https://careers.mozilla.org/) particularly if you are a platform or systems developer. Or, just [contributing in some way](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contribute/) to support the great work of the [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org).
