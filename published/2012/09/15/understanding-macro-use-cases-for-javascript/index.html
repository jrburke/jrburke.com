        <p>I just watched <a href="https://air.mozilla.org/sweetjs/">this Mozilla video on some experimental work Tim Disney is doing
for JS macros</a>. While
watching it, I also read came across <a href="http://calculist.org/blog/2012/04/17/homoiconicity-isnt-the-point/">Dave Herman's homoiconicity post</a>.</p>

<p>Interesting stuff, and helped me to better understand how macros might fit
into JavaScript, at least at a technical level.</p>

<p>My crude layman's explanation of macros: transpilers but only JS token
types are used, versus having to make your own whole grammar, and constrained to <strike>curlies</strike>
() {} [] as delimiters (thanks to Tim for the correction). These limitations are there in order to insert in a simplified
parser (called the reader) between the usual JS lexer and parser stages.</p>

<p>So macros seem to be useful when:</p>

<ul>
<li>you do not want a full transpiler, just some small syntax forms</li>
<li>and using a function() to do the code reuse is not appropriate</li>
</ul>

<p>I am having trouble visualizing those use cases though. My initial reaction is
that macros are something neat for a language enthusiast, but do not actually
make coding, the sharing and reading of code, that much better, particularly
since it involves a level of indirection that is subtle, the new grammar needs
to be tracked down. I find this is the hardest part of understanding codebases,
tracking down what different units of code are doing, where the definitions live.</p>

<p>My first impulse is to say, "just make a function" that does
what you want, using existing JS grammar.</p>

<p>If a function is not enough, what you are probably wanting is a full custom
language, so then a full grammar/transpiler makes sense.
The use of transpilers are easier to call out in their use -- normally a different
file extension, and by not being limited to JS token types/delimiters, you are
more likely to create a terser grammar.</p>

<p>I can see the need to make transpiler construction easier. And if someone wanted
to create a "like JS but with some tweaks", maybe create something higher
level than something like <a href="http://zaach.github.com/jison/">jison</a> to do that.
I would have liked that when playing around with module syntax for JS, for
example.</p>

<p>So it is hard for me to see the case for macros, at least as described in
that video. They seem to be a middle ground between functions and full
transpilers whose benefits seem to be outweighed by making it more difficult
to comprehend code written in "JavaScript".</p>

<p>But I am trying to learn more about it. If anyone has pointers to the cases
where macros shine and their use outweighs my perceived readability/code tracing
costs, I would love to hear it. Feel free to leave a comment.</p>

<p>However, do not comment with at "yeah macros are dumb". This is an exploration
in enlightenment. I'm already skeptical of macros, so I do not need that
reinforcement. I'm looking for more concrete use cases, pros and cons on specific
points, not fear of change.</p>

<p>Similarly, comments of the form "because, Language X has them and
they are awesome" will likely not be informative. It is likely language X and
JS do not share other properties and cultures that are in JS, like the
propensity to create transpilers for JS. I want uses cases that for JS would not
be solved via functions or a full transpiler.</p>
